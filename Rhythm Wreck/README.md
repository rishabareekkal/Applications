# Rhythm Wreck
A rhythm game inspired by the Rhythm Heaven game series. (School group project)

Contains a collection of 4 unique rhythm games, made using Unity Engine and C#.  
*Project Contributions:* Coded the graphical user interface including the start, file select, settings, game select, and shop screens as well as the pause screen overlay. Made a simple data persistence code that allowed the user to save game progress and setting preferences through serialization using a binary formatter. Created one of the mini games and programmed a scoring system, cosmetic collectibles, luck factor, visual effects/animations, and player assistance.
