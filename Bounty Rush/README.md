# Bounty Rush
A 2D shooting game based on Galaga, made using Unity Engine and C#. (School group project)

Move around your ship to avoid enemy bullets and fire back to destroy your enemies. It's an endless game so gun for a new record every round!  
Project Contributions: Created a complete graphical user interface for the game. Programmed a menu system with multiple scenes, a pause screen overlay, and a settings scene to adjust sound preferences.
