# Mini-Games
The Mini Games project with four mini games.

The four mini games are:
- "Asteroid Avoid" where you drag your mouse around to avoid the asteroids.
- "Fuse Defuse" where you copy patterns, connect wires, and cut wires.
- "Camo Clicker" where you click either a red or blue dot to get points.
- "Asteroid Attack" where you click on asteroids to destroy them.

Complete the games in order to see your completion mark.

*Best to be played on using a text editor rather than replit in order to see all the beautiful fonts!*
